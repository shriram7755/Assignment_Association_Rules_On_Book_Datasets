Association Rules:
Association rules are used to discover interesting relationships or patterns among a set of items in large datasets. These rules are typically in the form of "if-then" statements. For example, in a retail dataset, an association rule might be "if a customer buys product A, they are likely to buy product B as well."

Apriori Algorithm:
The Apriori algorithm is one of the most widely used algorithms for mining association rules. It works by iteratively discovering frequent itemsets in a dataset and then generating association rules from these itemsets. The algorithm is based on the "apriori property," which states that if an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent.
